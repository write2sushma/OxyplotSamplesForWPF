# OxyplotSamplesForWPF
Oxyplot is an open source library for charting plots. Though it has great potential, most of the support is implemented for DotNet and this library doesn't provide any good examples or even proper documentation for using Oxyplot with WPF.  

I struggled a lot while trying to implement a heatmap chart in my WPF project. So, I have made my own repository with some sample code for charting with Oxyplot in WPF. I hope it would be helpful to some other developers.
